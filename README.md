# Data-Science-Project

This project is about crime analysis and prediction in New York city. Using Streamlit framework, python and Machine Learning on our dataset we are able to predict the probability that a crime ocurs in spatial and temporal conditions.

###### The notebook "Data-exploration.ipynb" contains the exploration of the dataset using graphs. For example: a graph of number of crimes per bourough.
###### The notebook "Data-cleaning.ipynb" contains steps to clean our dataset.
###### The notebook "Crime-prediction-using-RF.ipynb" is about crime prediction using RandomForest model.
## To run the web app 
* $ streamlit run app.py
